# Hey there! 👋

This is my personal portfolio website - a place where I showcase my projects, skills, and tell a bit about myself. Think of it as my digital business card that actually looks good and works well.

## What's cool about it?

**🔐 Easy Login**: I use Discord to log in (because who wants another password?), and it remembers me for 30 days. Super convenient!

**🎨 Pretty Design**: Dark purple theme with some fancy glass effects. It's responsive too, so it looks great on your phone, tablet, or computer.

**📱 Simple Navigation**: 
- **Home page** shows my best projects and skills
- **Projects page** has everything with filters if you want to browse by technology
- **Admin area** where I manage my content (shh, that's just for me!)

**🚀 Project Showcase**: My projects are displayed in a smart grid that adapts based on how many I have. Each project shows the tech I used, links to live demos, and GitHub repos.

**💻 Skills Section**: I organize my skills by category (Frontend, Backend, etc.) and show my experience level. Some even link to documentation if you're curious!

## Built with love using:

- Node.js + Express (the backend magic)
- SQLite (simple, fast database)
- Discord OAuth (easy authentication)
- Vanilla JavaScript + EJS (no crazy frameworks needed)
- Custom CSS (because I like control)
- Font Awesome icons (they look professional)

## What can you do here?

**If you're just browsing:**
- Check out my projects and see what I've built
- Learn about my skills and experience
- Read about me and what I do
- Everything works smoothly on any device

**If you're me (admin):**
- Update my profile and about section
- Add, edit, or remove projects
- Manage my skills list
- Keep everything organized and up-to-date

## Behind the scenes:

The site handles sessions properly (so I stay logged in), optimizes images for fast loading, has proper SEO tags for sharing, and includes all the boring but important stuff like error handling and security.
